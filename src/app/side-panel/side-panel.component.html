    <p>Africa has long been a continent mired by deadly conflicts. Still dealing with the effects of European colonialism, racial tension, natural resource management, disease, and political upheaval still plague many areas. But not all areas are affected the same! Zoom to circle markers to explore hubs of conflicts in greater detail.</p>
    <p>This map explores African conflicts resulting in at least one fatality for the entire year 2018. Data was aggregated and manipulated in Jupyter Notebook with Python 3 and pandas. The map is created with Leaflet and the Leaflet ClusterMarkers plugin.</p>
